Add Service as a Service Service
====

Adding Service to your project can be as challenging as the goal is vague. 

We're here to help.

If you're interested, feel free to fork this ASSS, then use git to pull the service out of your own ASSS.
Viola, you've got a bullet point to add to your slide deck and all is right with the world!



Granted, if you're actually interested in working with Services to tie into a back end, or are interested in getting your back-end scaled and supported, feel free to talk to us at services@...
